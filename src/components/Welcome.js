      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_ballad">Murder Ballad</a> is a sub-genre of music which focuses on murder as the main part of its narrative. There are often other related themes - love, jealousy, hardship, justice - but the form has remained largely constant for hundreds of years.</p>
